## Hi there, I'm Isabella 👋

I’m a BSIT and Cybersecurity student at the University of Cincinnati with concentrations in Software Development and Data Technologies. I’m interested in building well-structured applications and understanding how software, data, and networks work together in real-world systems.

My coursework and projects emphasize **clean organization**, **correct implementation**, and **collaboration**, with a growing focus on security and system reliability.
